UPGRADE NOTES (added by ChatGPT)
- To set a custom hero background, replace /assets/hero-bg.jpg (JPG for photos, PNG for graphics, SVG for patterns).
- Color palette lives in CSS variables at the top of styles.css.
  Recommended usage ratio:
    Primary ~60%, Secondary ~30%, Accent ~10% (for highlights & CTAs).
- Replace app screenshots inside /assets and update filenames in the Screens section if needed.
- All sections are mobile-first and accessible. Aim for AA contrast (≥ 4.5:1 for body text).
